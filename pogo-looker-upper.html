       So... when playing Pokemon GO, there's this situation which
       comes up every now and then - you're about to fight some
       pokemon, and you see it's a WATER type. The app suggests a
       team for you to enter the fray with, but often it's not a very
       strong team because it doesn't take the defender's weaknesses
       into consideration.

       What I normally do then is to google the defender's type, get
       to a web page with a zillion ads, scroll down lots and lots where I may or may not find a
       table where I look up the type. If it was type WATER, I find
       out that this pokemon is weak to Fire, Ground, and Rock
       attacks.

       Next, I re-open Pokemon GO, and search among my Pokemon for
       any which has moves which belong to one of he three
       attacks. PoGo has a weird search syntax, and I need to type
       the following:

       @1fire,@1ground,@1rock&@2fire,@2ground,@2rock

       This is, needless to say, a major PITA.

       So I decided to write a little webpage which does the lookup
       for me. Along the way I even learned some (very basic)
       javascript. Yay for me!
